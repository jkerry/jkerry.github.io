We've standardized our kitchen verifier on
[Inspec](https://github.com/chef/inspec) at my corner of NCR and we're in need
of a solution for reporting test-kitchen runs from pull request verifiers in
jenkins. The default test reporting format for most jenkins jobs is the
[JUnit xml format](https://github.com/windyroad/JUnit-Schema). We're lucky
because unlike chefspec Inspec operates on the host rather than the kitchen vm.
This means that we can use Inspec's `--format JUnit` option and consume it with
jenkins reporting.

# Cookbook Testing with Inspec

If you'd like to switch your cookbook's default verifier to inspec change your
.kitchen.yml verifier to match something like the following:

```ruby
verifier:
  name: inspec
  format: junit
  output: ./inspec_output.xml
```

The `format:` option corresponds with the --format cli option. you'll likely
need the kitchen-inspec gem. Note the output file location for Jenkins. It might
be worth noting that the test location in your cookbook will change with the
verifier name.

See [my resum√©](https://github.com/jkerry/CookbookResume) for an example.

# Jenkins Configuration

Now that you've got a a target you can use inspec's cli `--format junit` argument
or kitchen-inspec's junit xml output all you need to do is consume the junit xml
as a post-build event in Jenkins.  This comes with the stock installation and is
is the defacto way to aggregate test results in jenkins:

and Bam! you've got web ui test results and aggregation.

Now the only thing left to do is for me to fix the errors in my cover letter so
we don't have any embarrassing failures to report..
