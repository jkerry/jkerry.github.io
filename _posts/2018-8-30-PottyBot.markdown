I'm the father of two young boys ages four and two. Potty training is not fun by any means of measurement. Common wisdom currently is that no matter the situation or circumstances you are not to punish a child for accidents. Instead you should reward and encourage successes. This totally makes sense and I get it, but after a while this can seriously stress the boundaries of your parental creativity. I have run out of things to promise. I've watched reward charts go unfilled and unwanted. There has to be a way to make all of this more engaging!
