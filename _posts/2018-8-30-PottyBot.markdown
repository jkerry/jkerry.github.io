I'm the father of two young boys ages four and two. Potty training is not fun by any means of measurement. Common wisdom currently is that no matter the situation or circumstances you are not to punish a child for accidents. Instead you should reward and encourage successes. This totally makes sense and I get it, but after a while this can seriously stress the boundaries of your parental creativity. I have run out of things to promise. I've watched reward charts go unfilled and unwanted. There has to be a way to make all of this more engaging or I'm going to run out of resources to up the ante.

# The AIY Voice Kit

I picked up the [Google AIY Voice Kit](https://www.target.com/p/google-voice-kit-aiy/-/A-53416295) while cruising through target looking for a printer with a decently economical tank because it looked like it would be interesting to fiddle with. The kit is a Pi Zero with supporting audio devices, an activation button, and a cardboard enclosure. When I first set it up my older son had a blast asking google questions and on the technical side it was pretty impressive. The AIY project has all the python code that drives the audio and video devices together [here](https://github.com/google/aiyprojects-raspbian).
